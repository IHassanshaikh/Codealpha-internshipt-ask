As part of my journey, I completed two fun and challenging tasks: an Age Calculator and a To-Do List application. Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of both:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Age Calculator: I built a simple tool that calculates your exact age based on your birth date. It takes the input for year, month, and day, then calculates the difference from today's date, adjusting for months and days. The result shows your age in years, months, and days.

2Ô∏è‚É£ To-Do List: This is a dynamic task management app where you can add tasks, edit them, change their status (Pending, In Progress, Done), and even remove tasks. Each task is added to a table with unique IDs, making it easy to track multiple tasks.

These projects helped me sharpen my JavaScript and DOM manipulation skills! üíª‚ú®
